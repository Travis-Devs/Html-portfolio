 <h1>The best movies according to Travis</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of this year are</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Venom 3</h3>
 <p>This was a great movie becaus it's Venom, my only critisism is he was not Venom nearly enough.</p>
 <h3>Deadpool and Wolverine</h3>
 <p>This was a great cross over film, it was hilarious, it was action packed and it opned up a doorway for expanding the MCU.</p>
 <h3>Pet Semetary</h3>
 <p>I added this one because i love scary movies, this one is exceptionally creepy and such an original story. Must watch!!</p>
